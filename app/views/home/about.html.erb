<h1>About This Site</h1>

<p>
  This site uses Google's profanity API, exposed through Google's <i>What do you love?</i> site (<%= link_to "wdyl.com/profanity?q=foo", "http://wdyl.com/profanity?q=foo" %>).  There are some obvious shortcomings, such as leaving out whitespaces, but oh well.  This was a short, half-hour project.  Oh, and it's built on Rails.  Yep.  Way overkill for this site.  Start the criticism now.
</p>

<p>
  As stated above, this site uses Google's profanity API, and therefore all profanity detections are subject to Google's dictionary of naughty words.  As I'm sure you'll find out, this dictionary of Google is <i>very</i> conservative.  I mean... <i>poop</i> is deemed profanity by it. It would seem that Google is taking its parental role very seriously.  ;)

  Anyway, try not to take the interwebs too seriously.
