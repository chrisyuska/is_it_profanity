Is It Profanity?

  This is an ultra simple Rails app designed to deem words or phrases "profane" based on Google's profanity API, exposed through their "What do you love?" site, http://wdyl.com/profanity?q=foo.

  All code should be fairly straightforward given the app's simplicity.  I will not be creating an API for my site as I recommend you use Google's API if you're interested in acheiving the same thing.
